# CARETAKER

Rails app generated with lewagon/rails-templates, created by the Le Wagon coding bootcamp team.

This app is the result of my Le Wagon's final project.

You can find it live on: http://www.caretaker.pt/

It was developed by me (Rui Magalh√£es) and my friend Emanuel Moniz (https://github.com/emanuelmoniz/)

## Getting Started

1. To get this web-service working on your localhost, do the following:

-**After cloning the project, do the following on your terminal:**

```
#TERMINAL
brew update
bundle install
Yarn instal
rails db: create
rails db: migrate
rails db:seed
```
- **On your .env file put your claudinary key, your email adress, your email app password and your host website)**
```
#.ENV file
CLOUDINARY_URL= ************************************
EMAIL_ADDRESS=something@something.something
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=**********
HOST=www.something.something
```
**-You need to install sidekiq too, for those asynchronous jobs. To do that, do the following on your terminal:**
```
#TERMINAL
brew update
brew install redis
brew services start redis
redis-cli FLUSHALL
bundle binstub sidekiq
bundle binstub sidekiq -- force
```
**Now, you are ready to see this project from your own machine.
Do the following, on your terminal:**
```
#TERMINAL:
sidekiq
```
**Still on the terminal, but on another tab:**
```
#TERMINAL:
rails s
```

**After this, you can open the app in your local server: http://localhost:3000/**
