# CARETAKER

Rails app generated with lewagon/rails-templates, created by the Le Wagon coding bootcamp team.

This app is the result of my Le Wagon's final project.It was developed by me (Rui Magalh√£es) and my friend Emanuel Moniz (https://github.com/emanuelmoniz/)

You can find it live on: http://www.caretaker.pt/
